          <p> Hi, I'm Jeff and my last name actually is Hacker.  This is fortunate as
            I recently decided to change my career path to become a
            Software Developer.  Along with my portfolio and Github, I am counting on
            this small coincidence to encourage you to interview me.
          </br></br>
            I know that as an employer, you want to learn what you can about me as a person,
            how I would work on your team, and will I fit in to your company culture.</br>
            With this in mind, I invite you to follow me on Twitter</a>
            <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffreyHacker">@JeffreyHacker</a>.
            I read more than I Tweet, but when I do post, I hope that you enjoy articles
            about business, networking, Django and software, how to improve your mind,
            a few smart comics, and random news stories that appeal to me. </br>
            </br>
            I have a wide variety of interests that add to my overall enjoyment of life,
            but what really drives me as a person is experience and learning.  I am
            very serious about what I do, but I also rely on a sense of humor to keep my perspective
            during a difficult task or in a stressful situation; events that are likely to happen at a
            hard-working company. </br> I am not easily offended and I am respectful of those
            around me regardless of their personal take on life.</br>
            My hope is to find interesting, quality minded
            people to work with.  I want to learn, grow, make my customer happy, and my
            employer profitable.
            </br>
            I currently live near Columbia, SC but I am available to work almost anywhere.
            Location is not a serious issue for me and I am open to your suggestions including
            remote work as I am self-motivated.</br>
            </br>
            I recently spent four months, 24/7 doing nothing but preparing for, and learning code at The Iron Yard.
            I completed the Python Engineering course with a focus on Django/Python and Data Science.
            If you are familiar with The Iron Yard, you know that this is no small task. </br>
            I now spend my days improving my existing code skills, learning new tools,
            networking with like minded individuals, and generally have a great time doing so.
            But, now I need to plug in somewhere to become my best.</br>
            If you represent a great company who wants a solid individual that you can rely on to do
            his best every day and be honest with you, please contact me.  I may just be your guy.</br>
